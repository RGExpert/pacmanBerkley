STUFF I CHANGED TO IMPLEMENT PORTALS 

Graphics:
Added a portal grid to the layout: 0 - no portal	
								   1 - blue portal
								   2 - red portal
								   
								   
Added a drawPortal method in graphics display


Game logic:

Changed the getSuccessor() (searchAgents.py) function so that it takes into account the portals 

Changed the generateSuccessor() in the Configuration class(game.py) function so that 
it updates the configuration to an exact position if a portal was used

Changed the applyAction in game.py So it updates the configuration of the pacman 
the the position of the next portal



Bug fixes:

Changed the way the cost is computed, it needs to be independent of the action taken,
previosly the cost was computed betwween two neighbooring locations

Changed registerInitalState so the correct path is shown

Maps: 
added mediumMazePort  mediumMaze + portals
added mediumCornersPort mediumCorners + portals
added trickySearchPort trickySearch + portals
